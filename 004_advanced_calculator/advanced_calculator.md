# Exercise 3: Advanced Calculator

Write a program that performs advanced arithmetic operations on two numbers.

## Task
- Ask the user for two numbers
- Calculate and display all six arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and power

## Example
```
Enter first number: 15
Enter second number: 4
15 + 4 = 19
15 - 4 = 11
15 × 4 = 60
15 ÷ 4 = 3.75
15 % 4 = 3
15 ^ 4 = 50625
```

## Expected Output Format
The program should output exactly:
```
[num1] + [num2] = [result]
[num1] - [num2] = [result]
[num1] × [num2] = [result]
[num1] ÷ [num2] = [result]
[num1] % [num2] = [result]
[num1] ^ [num2] = [result]
```

## Operations Explained
- **Addition (+)**: num1 + num2
- **Subtraction (-)**: num1 - num2
- **Multiplication (×)**: num1 * num2
- **Division (÷)**: num1 / num2 (gives decimal result)
- **Modulo (%)**: num1 % num2 (remainder after division)
- **Power (^)**: num1 ** num2 (num1 raised to the power of num2)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Program asks for two numbers
- ✅ Program calculates all six operations correctly
- ✅ Output format matches the example exactly
- ✅ Uses correct mathematical symbols
