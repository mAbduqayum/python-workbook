# Exercise: Area of a Triangle

Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle using base and height.

## Task
- Read the length of the base (as `int`)
- Read the height (as `int`)
- Calculate and display the area (as `float`)

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
Enter base length: 10
Enter height: 5
Area of triangle: 25.00
```

**Example 2:**
```
Enter base length: 8
Enter height: 12
Area of triangle: 48.00
```

**Example 3:**
```
Enter base length: 15
Enter height: 7
Area of triangle: 52.50
```

## Formula
`Area = (base Ã— height) / 2`

## Note
Use `.2f` formatting to display 2 decimal places.
