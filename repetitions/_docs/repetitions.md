# Repetition Structures in Python

## Introduction

In the previous chapters, you worked with sequential programs and programs that
use conditional statements to make
decisions.
While these constructs are powerful, many interesting problems require executing
the same code multiple times. For
example:

- Printing a pattern with 100 rows
- Reading values until the user enters a specific value
- Processing each character in a string
- Finding the sum of numbers from 1 to 1000

Writing the same code repeatedly would be impractical and error-prone. **Loops**
allow you to execute a block of code
multiple times efficiently.

## The Two Types of Loops

Python provides two main types of loops:

1. **`for` loop** - Used when you know how many times to repeat
2. **`while` loop** - Used when you repeat based on a condition

## The `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a range of numbers, a
string, or a list).

### Basic Syntax

```python
for variable in sequence:
# code to execute
```

### Example: Counting from 1 to 5

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### The range() Function

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers and is commonly used with
for loops.

| Usage                      | Description                  | Example            | Generated Values   |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `range(stop)`              | From 0 to stop-1             | `range(5)`         | `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`    |
| `range(start, stop)`       | From start to stop-1         | `range(2, 6)`      | `2, 3, 4, 5`       |
| `range(start, stop, step)` | From start to stop-1 by step | `range(1, 10, 2)`  | `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`    |
| Backwards                  | Using negative step          | `range(10, 0, -1)` | `10, 9, 8, ..., 1` |

### Range Examples

```python
# Count 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Count 1 to 10
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)  # 1, 2, 3, ..., 10

# Count by 10s from 0 to 100
for i in range(0, 101, 10):
    print(i)  # 0, 10, 20, ..., 100

# Count backwards from 5 to 1
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(i)  # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

## Iterating Over Strings

You can iterate over each character in a string:

```python
word = "hello"
for char in word:
    print(char)
```

**Output:**

```
h
e
l
l
o
```

## The `while` Loop

The `while` loop repeats as long as a condition is true.

### Basic Syntax

```python
while condition:
# code to execute
# (usually modify something to eventually make condition false)
```

### Example 1: Count from 1 to 5

```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increment count
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Example 2: Reading Until Sentinel Value

**Problem**: Read numbers from the user until they enter 0.

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))
while num != 0:
    print(f"You entered: {num}")
    num = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))
print("Done!")
```

## Common Loop Patterns

### Pattern 1: Accumulation (Sum/Total)

Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10:

```python
total = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    total += i
print(f"Sum: {total}")  # Sum: 55
```

### Pattern 2: Counting

Count how many even numbers are between 1 and 10:

```python
count = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        count += 1
print(f"Even numbers: {count}")  # Even numbers: 5
```

### Pattern 3: Finding Maximum/Minimum

Find the maximum of numbers entered by the user:

```python
max_value = float('-inf')  # Start with very small value
for i in range(5):
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if num > max_value:
        max_value = num
print(f"Maximum: {max_value}")
```

> **Note:** For minimum, use `float('inf')` instead.

## Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop is called a **nested loop**. The inner loop executes
completely for each iteration of the
outer loop.

### Example: Triangle of Numbers

```python
n = int(input())

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=" ")
    print()
```

**Output (for n = 4):**

```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
```

## Loop Control Statements

### `break` - Exit the Loop Early

The `break` statement immediately exits the loop:

```python
# Find first number divisible by 7 between 100 and 200
for i in range(100, 201):
    if i % 7 == 0:
        print(f"Found: {i}")
        break  # Exit loop
```

### `continue` - Skip to Next Iteration

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to
the next:

```python
# Print odd numbers from 1 to 10
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

## Useful `print()` Parameters

### Printing on the Same Line

Use `end=""` parameter to prevent newline:

```python
# Print numbers on one line
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i, end=" ")  # Print with space separator
print()  # Newline at the end
# Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

### Using sep Parameter

```python
# sep separates multiple arguments in a single print call
print(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, sep="-")
# Output: 1-2-3-4-5
```

## When to Use `for` vs `while`

| Use `for` when:                              | Use `while` when:                            |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| You know the number of iterations in advance | You repeat based on a condition              |
| Iterating over a sequence (range, string)    | Reading input until a sentinel value         |
| Processing each element in a collection      | Continuing until a specific condition is met |
| Example: "Print 1 to 100"                    | Example: "Read until user enters 0"          |

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Infinite Loops

Make sure your loop condition will eventually become false:

```python
# WRONG - Infinite loop!
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    # Forgot to increment i!

# CORRECT
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### 2. Off-by-One Errors

Be careful with loop boundaries:

```python
# To print 1 to 10 (inclusive)
for i in range(1, 11):  # NOT range(1, 10)
    print(i)
```

### 3. Modifying Loop Variable in For Loop

Avoid modifying the loop variable inside a `for` loop:

```python
# WRONG - Don't modify i inside the loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    i += 1  # This doesn't affect the loop!

# Use a while loop if you need to control the increment
```

| Loop with index             | `for i in range(len(text)):`      | Access by index                |
| Loop with index (better)    | `for i, char in enumerate(text):` | Access index and value         |
| Break out of loop           | `break`                           | Exit loop immediately          |
| Skip to next iteration      | `continue`                        | Skip rest of current iteration |
| Infinite loop (be careful!) | `while True:`                     | Loop forever (use with break)  |
| Accumulate sum              | `total += value`                  | Add to running total           |
| Count occurrences           | `count += 1`                      | Increment counter              |

## Summary

Loops are essential for writing programs that process large amounts of data or
repeat tasks.

### Tips for Success

1. **Choose the right loop**: Use `for` when you know the count, `while` for
   conditions
2. **Initialize before the loop**: Set up accumulators, counters, and other
   variables
3. **Update inside the loop**: Make sure loop variables change to avoid infinite
   loops
4. **Test loop boundaries**: Verify your loop runs the correct number of times
5. **Use descriptive variable names**: `row`, `column`, `total` are better than
   `i`, `j`, `x`
6. **Indent properly**: Python requires correct indentation for loop bodies
7. **Debug with print statements**: Add `print()` to see what's happening in
   each iteration

### `else` After Loops

- Python supports an `else` clause on loops that executes when the loop
  completes without hitting a `break`. While this
  feature exists, it's not commonly used and can be confusing since it's unique
  to Python and not available in most other
  programming languages. We recommend avoiding it for clarity.
