# Exercise 122: What Day of the Week Is January 1?

Write a program that determines the day of the week for January 1st of a given year using a mathematical formula.

## Task
- Read a year from the user
- Calculate the day of the week for January 1st of that year
- Display the full name of the day

## Formula
```
day_of_week = (year + floor((year - 1) / 4) - floor((year - 1) / 100) + floor((year - 1) / 400)) % 7
```

## Day Mapping
| Result | Day of Week |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Sunday |
| 1 | Monday |
| 2 | Tuesday |
| 3 | Wednesday |
| 4 | Thursday |

Saturday
```

**Example 4:**
```
2000

```

**Example 5:**

1900
Monday
```

## Note
- Use `//` for integer division (floor division) in Python
- The formula accounts for leap years and century adjustments
- The result is an integer from 0-6 representing Sunday through Saturday
- Convert the numeric result to the full day name
