# Classifying Triangles

A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. Write a program that reads the lengths of three sides and determines the triangle's type.

## Task
- Read the lengths of the three sides of a triangle from the user
- Determine and display the triangle's classification
- Handle the three types of triangles appropriately

## Triangle Classifications
- **Equilateral**: All three sides have the same length
- **Isosceles**: Two sides have the same length, and the third side has a different length
- **Scalene**: All three sides have different lengths

```
