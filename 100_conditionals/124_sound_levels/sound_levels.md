# Sound Levels

Write a program that reads a sound level in decibels from the user and reports information about the sound based on common noise levels.

## Task
- Read a sound level in decibels from the user
- Display the corresponding noise if it matches exactly
- If the level is between noises, indicate which noises it falls between
- Handle values outside the range appropriately
