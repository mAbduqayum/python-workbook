# Exercise 119: Frequency to Name

Write a program that classifies electromagnetic radiation based on its frequency.

## Task
- Read a frequency in Hz from the user
- Determine the type of electromagnetic radiation
- Display the appropriate classification

## Electromagnetic Radiation Classifications
| Name | Frequency Range (Hz) |
|------|---------------------|
| Radio Waves | Less than 3 × 10⁹ |
| Microwaves | 3 × 10⁹ to less than 3 × 10¹² |
| Infrared Light | 3 × 10¹² to less than 4.3 × 10¹⁴ |
| Visible Light | 4.3 × 10¹⁴ to less than 7.5 × 10¹⁴ |
| Ultraviolet Light | 7.5 × 10¹⁴ to less than 3 × 10¹⁷ |
| X-Rays | 3 × 10¹⁷ to less than 3 × 10¹⁹ |
| Gamma Rays | 3 × 10¹⁹ or more |
