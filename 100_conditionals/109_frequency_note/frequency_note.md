# Exercise 109: Frequency to Note

Write a program that reverses the process of the previous exercise. Read a frequency from the user and determine if it corresponds to a known musical note.

## Task
- Read a frequency from the user (as a float)
- Determine if the frequency is within one Hertz of a known note
- Display the corresponding note name or indicate that no match was found
- Only consider the notes from the 4th octave (C4-B4)

## Reference Note Frequencies (4th Octave)
| Note | Frequency (Hz) |
|------|----------------|
| C4   | 261.63         |
| D4   | 293.66         |
| E4   | 329.63         |
| F4   | 349.23         |
| G4   | 392.00         |
| A4   | 440.00         |
| B4   | 493.88         |

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
440
A4
```

**Example 2:**
```
261
C4
```

**Example 3:**
```
262.5
C4
```

**Example 4:**
```
500
No match
```

**Example 5:**
```
392.8
G4
```

## Matching Logic
- A frequency matches a note if it's within Â±1 Hz of the note's frequency
- For example, A4 (440 Hz) matches frequencies from 439.0 to 441.0
- Check each note systematically to find a match

## Note
- Use `abs()` function to calculate the absolute difference
- Format the frequency display to 1 decimal place
- Only one note should match for any given frequency
- Handle the case where no note matches the input frequency
