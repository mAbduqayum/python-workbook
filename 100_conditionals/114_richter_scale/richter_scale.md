# Exercise: Richter Scale

Write a program that reads an earthquake magnitude and displays the appropriate descriptor according to the Richter scale.

## Task
- Read an earthquake magnitude from the user
- Display the corresponding earthquake descriptor
- Handle all magnitude ranges appropriately

## Richter Scale Classifications
| Magnitude               | Descriptor |
|-------------------------|------------|
| magnitude < 2.0         | Micro      |
| 2.0 <= magnitude < 3.0  | Very Minor |
| 3.0 <= magnitude < 4.0  | Minor      |
| 4.0 <= magnitude < 5.0  | Light      |
| 5.0 <= magnitude < 6.0  | Moderate   |
| 6.0 <= magnitude < 7.0  | Strong     |
| 7.0 <= magnitude < 8.0  | Major      |
| 8.0 <= magnitude < 10.0 | Great      |
| magnitude > 10.0        | Meteoric   |

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
1.5
```
```
Micro
```

**Example 2:**
```
2.5
```
```
Very Minor
```

**Example 3:**
```
5.5
```
```
Moderate
```

**Example 4:**
```
7.2
```
```
Major
```

**Example 5:**
```
8.9
```
```
Great
```

**Example 6:**
```
10.5
```
```
Meteoric
```

## About the Richter Scale
The Richter scale is a **logarithmic scale**, not linear. Each whole number increase represents a 10-fold increase in amplitude and approximately 31.6 times more energy release. For example, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake is 10 times stronger than a magnitude 4.0 earthquake.
