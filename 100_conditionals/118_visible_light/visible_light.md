# Exercise: Wavelengths of Visible Light

Write a program that reads a wavelength and reports the corresponding color of visible light.

## Task
- Read a wavelength in nanometers from the user
- Determine the color corresponding to that wavelength
- Handle wavelengths outside the visible spectrum

## Visible Light Spectrum
| Color | Wavelength Range (nm) |
|-------|----------------------|
| Violet | 380 to less than 450 |
| Blue | 450 to less than 495 |
| Green | 495 to less than 570 |
| Yellow | 570 to less than 590 |
| Orange | 590 to less than 620 |
| Red | 620 to 750 |

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
420
```
```
Violet
```

**Example 2:**
```
480
```
```
Blue
```

**Example 3:**

550
```
```
Green
```

**Example 4:**
```
600
```
```
Orange
```

**Example 5:**
```
700
```
```
Red
```

**Example 6:**
```
300
```
```
Outside visible spectrum
```

**Example 7:**
```
800
```
```
Outside visible spectrum
```
