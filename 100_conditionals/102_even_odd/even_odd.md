# Even or Odd?

Write a program that reads an integer from the user and determines whether the integer is `even` or `odd`.

## Task
- Read an integer from the user
- Determine if the number is even or odd
- Display "even" or "odd"

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
7
```
```
odd
```

**Example 2:**
```
4
```
```
even
```

**Example 3:**
```
0
```
```
even
```

**Example 4:**
```
-3
```
```
odd
```

## Logic
- If `number % 2 == 0`: even
- If `number % 2 != 0`: odd

## Note
- Zero is considered even
- The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of division
- Handle negative numbers (they follow the same rule)
