# Between Values

Write a program that determines if a value b is between two other values a and c.

## Task
- Read three numbers a, b, and c from the user
- Determine if b is between a and c (inclusive)
- Handle cases where a > c or a < c

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
5
7
10
```
```
between
```

**Example 2:**
```
10
7
5
```
```
between
```

**Example 3:**
```
5
12
10
```
```
not between
```

**Example 4:**
```
5
5
10
```
```
between
```

**Example 5:**
```
10
5
5
```
```
between
```

## Logic
- If a ≤ c: check if a ≤ b ≤ c
- If a > c: check if c ≤ b ≤ a
- Use inclusive comparison (≤ and ≥)

## Note
- Handle both ascending and descending ranges
- Include boundary values (b can equal a or c)
- The order of a and c doesn't matter for determining the range
