# List Items

Create three functions to get the first, middle, and last items from a list.

## Template:

```python
def first_item(items):
    pass


def mid_item(items):
    pass


def last_item(items):
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test your functions
    items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(first_item(items))  # 1
    print(mid_item(items))    # 3
    print(last_item(items))   # 5
```

## Note

- For lists with even length, mid_item returns the element at position len//2
- Assume the list is not empty
