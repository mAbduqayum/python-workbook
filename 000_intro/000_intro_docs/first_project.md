# Creating Your First Python Project

This guide will walk you through creating and running your first Python program.

## Create Your First Python Project

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to where you want to create your project (ex. `Documents`):
   ```
   cd Documents
   ```
3. Create a new Python project with uv:
   ```
   uv init first-project
   ```
4. Move into your new project folder:
   ```
   cd first-project
   ```

## Open Your Project in VS Code

1. While in your project folder in the terminal, type:
   ```
   code .
   ```
   (This opens the current folder in VS Code)

2. If VS Code doesn't open, you can:
    - Open VS Code manually
    - Go to File the Open Folder
    - Select your `first-project` folder

## Understanding Your Project

When you used `uv init`, it created several files:

- `pyproject.toml` - Contains project settings
- `.python-version` - Contains the python version
- `README.md` - Information about your project
- `main.py` - A sample Python file

## Write Your First Program

1. Open the `main.py` file (it should already exist)
2. Replace its contents with:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("I'm learning Python!")
```

## Run Your Program

1. In VS Code, open the terminal (Terminal â†’ New Terminal)
2. Run your program with:
   ```
    python main.py
   ```
3. You should see your messages printed in the terminal

## What Just Happened?

- **uv init** created a complete Python project structure for you
- **VS Code** is where you write and edit your code
- **python** executes your Python programs in a safe environment
- **Python** is the language that understands your code and makes it work

## Common Commands You'll Use

- `cd` - **C**hange **D**irectory   
- `uv init project-name` - Create a new Python project
- `code .` - Open the current folder in VS Code
- `python main.py` - Run a Python file
- `uv run main.py` - Alternative way to run a Python file

Congratulations! You now have a proper Python development setup, and you're ready to start programming.
