# Exercise: Area of a Triangle

Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle using base and height.

## Task

- Read the length of the base (as `float`)
- Read the height (as `float`)
- Calculate and display the area with `.2f` formatting

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Enter base length: 10.5
Enter height: 5.2
```

```
Area of triangle: 27.30
```

**Example 2:**

```
Enter base length: 8.3
Enter height: 12.1
```

```
Area of triangle: 50.22
```

**Example 3:**

```
Enter base length: 15.0
Enter height: 7.8
```

```
Area of triangle: 58.50
```

## Formula

`Area = (base Ã— height) / 2`

## Note

Use `.2f` formatting to display 2 decimal places.
