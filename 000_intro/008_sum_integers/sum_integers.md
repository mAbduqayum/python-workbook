# Exercise: Sum of the First n Positive Integers

Write a program that calculates the sum of all positive integers from 1 to n using the mathematical formula.

## Task

- Read a positive integer `n` from the user (as `int`)
- Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n
- Display the result

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Enter a positive integer: 5
```

```
The sum of integers from 1 to 5 is: 15
```

**Example 2:**

```
Enter a positive integer: 10
```

```
The sum of integers from 1 to 10 is: 55
```

**Example 3:**

```
Enter a positive integer: 100
```

```
The sum of integers from 1 to 100 is: 5050
```

## Formula

`sum = n Ã— (n + 1) / 2`
