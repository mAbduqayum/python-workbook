# Python Workbook Project

This is a structured collection of Python programming exercises designed for learning and practice.

## Project Structure

- Each exercise is in a numbered directory
  - `0**` basics
  - `1**` conditionals
  - `2**` repetitions
  - `3**` functions
  - `4**` lists
  - `5**` dictionaries
  - `6**` files and exceptions
  - `7**` recursion
- Exercise directories contain:
  - `*.md` file with problem description, examples, and formulas.
  - `*_hint.md` file with the hint to the question, but is given when is really necessary!
  - `*.py` file with the solution implementation. Don't solve the questions unless asked!
- Reference materials are in `x00_*/` directories

## Exercise Categories

- **Basic I/O**: Hello world, user input/output
- **Computer Science**: Arithmetic, geometry, area/perimeter calculations
- **Mathematics**: Arithmetic, geometry, area/perimeter calculations
- **Physics**: Free fall, ideal gas law, pressure conversions
- **Chemistry**: Free fall, ideal gas law, pressure conversions
- **Biology**: Free fall, ideal gas law, pressure conversions
- **Finance**: Interest calculations, tip calculators, banking
- **Time/Date**: Time conversions, date calculations
- **Utilities**: Sorting, string manipulation, unit conversions

## Testing and Validation

- Manually verify outputs match the examples in the `.md` files
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure mathematical calculations are accurate to specified precision
- Use Python REPL or scripts to validate formulas and expected outputs

## Mathematical Accuracy

- Double-check all mathematical formulas using Python calculations
- Use proper mathematical constants (e.g., `math.pi`, `math.e`)
- Verify trigonometric calculations use correct units (radians vs degrees)
- Test complex formulas (Heron's formula, great circle distance, etc.) thoroughly

## Exercise Workflow

1. Read the `.md` file to understand requirements
2. Never create `.py` files unless told
3. Verify outputs match examples exactly
4. Test mathematical formulas independently
5. Fix any calculation or formatting errors
6. Ensure all examples produce correct results
